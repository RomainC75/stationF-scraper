## Description

Just a little script to put the content of the job offers a mysql database from the station F website. 
I just wanted to use OOP including the models which are written with mysql2. ðŸ’ª
 
## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Libraries : puppeteer / puppeteer-cluster / mysql2
* Docker and the mysql container

### Installing

Mysql container:
```
docker run --name stationF_mysql -p 3306:3306 -d -v "${PWD}/mysql/storage":/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<...db_password...> -e MYSQL_DATABASE=stationf mysql
```
```

Don't forget to set the password of the database in a **.env** file :
```
DB_PASS=<db_password>
```
